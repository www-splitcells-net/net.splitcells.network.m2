# net-splitcells-individual-distributable (NSID)

This is a pseudo license.
Files marked with this license, have their own license, copyright notice and similar in the file itself.
Files are only allowed to be marked with this pseudo license,
if at least copying and distributing the file without changes is allowed.

This pseudo license is used, so it can be ensured,
that every file has license info in its meta data.
This is needed because SPDX does not seem to have a dedicated identifier for non-standard licenses,
that indicates a minimum amount of rights.
Thereby, REUSE compliance in spirit probably becomes a bit better as files without a license identifier are omitted.

This is especially useful for legal documents,
where one wants to avoid any changes being done on these, if possible.
